/*
 * Application Programming Interface (API)
 * 
 * To allow other plugins or extensions to interact directly with Zombie Plague Mod we need to implement
 * an API.  SourceMod allows us to do this by creating global "natives" or "forwards."
 * 
 * To better understand how natives and forwards are created, go here:
 * http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Creating_Natives_(SourceMod_Scripting)
